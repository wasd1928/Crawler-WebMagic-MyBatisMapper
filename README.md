## Project structure

I used WebMagic as the crawler framework. In order to connect database, I choose MyBatis as the framework, which can perform MySQL statements. Jsoup is used for processing the web pages.

Here is the structure of this framework:

The class Spider is assembled by these parts: 

Scheduler: decide which page to visit next and whether to visit.

PageProcesser: extract the information from web pages. Itâ€™s critical to fetch the correct information we want.

Downloader: download and process the page.

Other part: 

Pipeline: decide how to process the result we get from website; you can choose to store the data somewhere.
